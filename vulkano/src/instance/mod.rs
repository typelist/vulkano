//! API entry point.
//!
//! The first thing to do before you start using Vulkan is to create an `Instance` object.
//!
//! Creating an instance initializes everything and allows you to:
//! 
//!  - Enumerate physical devices, ie. all the Vulkan implementations that are available on
//!    the system.
//!  - Enumerate monitors.
//!  - Create surfaces (fullscreen or windowed) which will later be drawn upon.
//!
//! Enumerating monitors and creating surfaces can only be done if the proper extensions are
//! available and have been enabled. It is possible for a machine to support Vulkan without
//! support for rendering on a screen.
//!
//! # Application info
//! 
//! When you create an instance, you have the possibility to pass an `ApplicationInfo` struct. This
//! struct contains various information about your application, most notably its name and engine.
//! 
//! Passing such a structure allows for example the driver to let the user configure the driver's
//! behavior for your application alone through a control panel.
//!
//! # Enumerating physical devices
//!
//! After you have created an instance, the next step is to enumerate the physical devices that
//! are available on the system with `PhysicalDevice::enumerate()`.
//!
//! When choosing which physical device to use, keep in mind that physical devices may or may not
//! be able to draw to a certain surface (ie. to a window or a monitor), or may even not be able
//! to draw at all. See the `swapchain` module for more information about surfaces.
//!
//! A physical device can designate a video card, an integrated chip, but also multiple video
//! cards working together or a software implementation. Once you have chosen a physical device,
//! you can create a `Device` object from it. See the `device` module for more info.
